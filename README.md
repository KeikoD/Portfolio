# A.N.T.s (A New Technology)
A.N.T.s is an interactive art presentation I coded in Unity for my Honor’s Arts and Performance class. I wanted to try and combine art and code for an assignment who’s only theme was a “cycle”. It was created using Unity and C#. The project is a commentary on the fear and distrust people have on A.I. When new technologies are created, the media often reports on the fears people have of it. When self-driving cars were beginning to become popular with Tesla, people asked if they would intentionally kill people and go rogue like Hal 9000 or the robots from Terminator. In my project, I compare A.I. to ants through their ability to break down when discovering infinite loops. When ants get trapped in a pheromone cycle produced by other ants, they run in a circle until they die. If an A.I. has the slightest mistake, it can be caught in an infinite loop and break. While computer science has the potential to cause immense amounts of damage, we are still far from able to code A.I. that can become sentient let alone evil. My project displays my understanding of coding techniques and my ability to apply my skill to other subjects like art.

# Math Knights
Math Knights is an educational math game I coded in Software Engineering with two other students. We collaborated to create an RPG-style adventure game where elementary school children could have fun while learning basic math skills. The game followed a “math knight” who had to save a fantasy kingdom by defeating monsters. Before each fight, the player could enchant their gear by solving simple math problems in a set amount of time. The game includes a tutorial, animations, music, and an explorable map. This project displays my ability to collaborate with others to code efficiently.

# Typing Biscuits
“Typing Biscuits” is a desktop app that encourages efficient and healthy typing practices. The app uses interactive elements along with a database to give motivation and rewards for consistent work. It utilizes a combination of Unity with C#, HTML, GitHub, JavaScript, and Firebase. By using my app, users are able to type for longer stretches of time without getting distracted and can schedule healthy breaks. This project consists of scientific and artistic creativity and keeps users’ health in mind. I designed the app with global responsibility in mind to create an app that encourages healthy practices.

# Database
This database was intended to compile and store users’ ideas. The ideas could then be shared and compared with other users’ to encourage collaboration. The database compared the medium, topic, and proposed design of the ideas stored in itself. The database was designed with java and SQL code. The images in the zip file show the layout of my database and how the modules connect together.

# Pig-Player
Pig-Player is a series of java files that creates a game of Pig and its players. The code has 2 AI players with their own strategies for winning. This was one of the  first coding projects I created. Therefore, it is not as complex as future projects, but it was a big milestone for my growth as a computer programmer. I employed a lot of critical thinking for this project to use my new coding knowledge.
